    Loom is a Headless Media Asset Management System which is still in __early development__.

    At the moment there are no public sources or binaries available for download. If you are however interested in the development process or have general question I recommend to checkout my [blog](/blog/day0-let-there-be-loom).

    
    Loom is a private project which is not backed by a company. The design, development is done by [Johannes Sch√ºth](#team).


    Although Loom is a new development it will inherit code and concepts of [Gentics Mesh](https://github.com/gentics/mesh). Mesh is a headless CMS project which Johannes helped to design and develop from 2006 until leaving Gentics in early 2021.
