* Coke vs. Sprite
* Ketchup vs. Majo
* Eclipse vs. IntelliJ
* Java vs. Kotlin vs. Rust

Almost 99% of the time there is no perfect solution to a problem.
If someone asks me what tools I would recommend I tend to say to choose the tool that works best for you personally.

For the setup I'm going to describe my personal preference which is based on my own experience.


## Setup

I'm using link:https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] for my java project structure.

With maven you can create modules in which to split your project into different components.

### Root POM

The root level of my project is called 'maven-parent'.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<groupId>io.metaloom</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-parent</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<packaging>pom</packaging>
----

All the maven projects under metaloom share this parent. This means all modules also inherit the properties and plugin definitions. I use this parent module to:

* Define common maven repositories via `repositories` section.
* Pin the maven plugin version via the `pluginManagement` section.
* Pin very common maven dependency version (e.g. JUnit) via the `dependencyManagement` section.

### Vert.x Root POM

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<groupId>io.metaloom.vertx</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-vertx-parent</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<packaging>pom</packaging>
----

I use my `maven-vertx-parent` to pin and define Vert.x dependencies via the `dependencyManagement` section.

I think it is also possible to include a bom (BillOfMaterials POM) link:https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-dependencies[from Vert.x].

### Loom Maven Modules

For Loom I decided to modularize as much as possible. I know that this can quickly result in dependency hell situations but I'd rather deal with dependency hell than spaghetti code.

While working on Mesh I made a few bad design decisions. For one I put REST API code, Domain model code and business logic in one `core` module. The `api`, `rest-api`, `rest-modules` and search integration and other parts were in dedicated modules but having everything in the core resulted in a lot of effort that was needed to isolate and refactor the database code. The situation was even worse since the domain model classes also contained most of the business logic.

For Loom I decided to create modules for each aspect of the application and move non-api code that needs to be shared across modules into the `common` module. The `service` modules can thus depend on this code in order to implement their functionality.

The `core` module aggregates all service modules and provides bundle that can be depended by the `container` modules which are used to generated the final executable shaded jar.

## Recommendations

### Use BOM POM

* Use a dedicated BOM pom in your project to manage dependencies

First Define your `bom` module.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
	<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

	<parent>
		<groupId>io.metaloom.loom</groupId>
		<artifactId>loom</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</parent>

	<artifactId>loom-bom</artifactId>
	<name>Loom - BOM</name>

	<dependencyManagement>
		<dependencies>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>commons-cli</groupId>
				<artifactId>commons-cli</artifactId>
				<version>1.4</version>
			</dependency>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
				<artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
				<version>3.12.0</version>
			</dependency>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>commons-io</groupId>
				<artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>
				<version>2.8.0</version>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>
</project>
----

Next import it in your project modules

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.metaloom.loom</groupId>
            <artifactId>loom-bom</artifactId>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Now you can add dependencies without defining the dep version.
.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>commons-cli</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-cli</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: Add your project dependencies to your bom pom. This way you can avoid ```<version>${project.version}</version>```.

### Modularize your application

It might be tempting to throw various components of your application in one module but that can turn out to be a problem when you need to refactor something.

For Loom I'll place the interfaces into the `common` module. This way all services can access these and depend upon them.

The service implementations can now utilize the interfaces. When using dagger this is especially useful since you can create bindings for specific implementations. The services do not know which implementation they are using. Instead they just inject a dependency based on the interface. I'll cover this in a dedicated post in which we'll take a closer look on how I use dagger to manage dependency injection.
