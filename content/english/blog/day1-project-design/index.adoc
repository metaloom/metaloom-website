## Basics

For Loom I knew what kind of building blocks were required since it is basically just a continuation of my work on Mesh.

In the past I choose the approach to generate the spec and database schema from code. At least for the database that seemed a good choice at the time since the embedded DB of Mesh could be directly controlled via Java.

This time I'll however decided to handle things differently. First I want to define the API specification and from that information I would derive the needed domain model.

Let's take a look at the building blocks first.

## Step 1 - Building Blocks

### Assets
Around the `Assets` which are the key component of Loom are various other elements arranged.

### ACL
Additionally an `ACL` system is needed which consists of `User`, `Group`, `Role` and permission management.

### Tagging

Tags can be stored in the system which can be used to tag elements.

### Namespaces

`Namespaces` are used to scope content and asset elements.

### Content Models

`Content Models` are used to define the structure of your content elements.
A model defines a list of fields which can hold the content information.
`Field` types can be numbers, dates, JSON, text, booleans.

### Contents

The `Content` are elements which can be created in order to supplement the information from the assets.

## Step 2 - API Functions / OpenAPI

### UUID

For the resource identifier I choose link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)[UUIDv4].

### HTTP Methods

* `POST`   - Partial update / Create new resource
* `GET`    - Load the resource
* `HEAD`   - Check the resource without returning the content
* `PUT`    - Create resource with id
* `DELETE` - Delete the resource

### REST Models

The OpenAPI spec also contains

UserResponse:
    allOf:
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/EditableElement"
    required:
    - username
    properties:
    uuid:

### Paging

## Step 3 - Domain Model / Database Design

Each main building block gets a dedicated table `group`, `role`, `user`.

Relations between elements are stored in individual cross tables (e.g. `user_role`, `user_group`)
