## What is Loom?

Loom is a headless media asset management server platform. It provides a tools to inventory your media assets and extract the most information from them in order to provide you with a server that can be used to query the data in a structured way.

## What is MetaLoom?

MetaLoom is the umbrella which provides a home for all Loom related side projects and components.

## Why developing Loom?

From 2006 till 2021 I helped design and develop Gentics Mesh which is an open source headless CMS.
It is a great tool but has some very serious design flaws. With Loom I plan to take the "good parts" of Mesh and give them a new home.

Additionally I have already experimented on some media asset processing a while back and would like to share these tools / processes in a consistent manner. Creating a dedicated server which provides a home for this seems a good solution.

While working on Mesh I really liked the idea to put all my skills to use on a single project. With Loom I plan to continue this.

## When can we use it?

Once it is readyâ„¢

## Will it be open source?

Yes - Apache 2 License

## I know/like/use Mesh - What will be the differences?

So far:

* No branches
* Limited versioning
* No tag families
* No binary fields
* No plugins
* No dedicated schema migration
* No OrientDB

New:

* S3 support
* Native SSO support (Keycloak, Auth0)
* Asset System
* Media Fingerprinting
* Overhauled permission system

## What stack do you plan to use?

* Vert.x - For the core
* Dagger - For the glue
* RxJava2 - For the reactiveness
* Vertx-Jooq - For persistence
* Elasticsearch - You Know, for Search!
* OpenCV - Media processing
* Tika - Metadata extraction
* TwelveMonkeys - Image decoding/encoding
